# Extended ModFM oscillator (version 2)

This oscillator implements Extended ModFM with the following parameters

- Shape: phase modulator amount (-1 to 1)

- Shift-Shape: modfm modulator amount (0 to 1)

- LFO shape: modulation index

The following menu parameters are available

- Car ratio: carrier frequency multiplier

- Mod ratio: modulation frequency multiplier

- Mod fine: modulation frequency fine detune

- Attack time: attack time in % (0 - 10s) of internal AR envelope generator.

- Release time: release time in % (0 - 10s) of internal AR envelope generator.

- ndx amount: modulation index (if release/attack time is 0),
  otherwise modulation index envelope amount.
